<b>I made the following modifications on 03.03.2018:</b>
																	   		
1. Ready to enter the search string right after the start
2. pressing Enter after entering the search string starts the search immediately
3. the buttons R, W, C now show their long name
4. the window displays the number of files read so far and the number of digits found during the search process
5. Font size and window size is adapted to 4k monitors
6. Counter for number of searched files, number of files with the searched string and the total number of found hits
